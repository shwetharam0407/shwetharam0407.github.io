A fun project I worked on as a sophomore interning at the Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Lab of Indian Institute of Science. A Kinect was used to track the foot movements of the Bharatanatyam (a South Indian classical dance) dancer and playback a suitable Mridangam (a percussion instrument) sound.

It'll be interesting to revisit this, now that I know a little more of Computer Vision!
