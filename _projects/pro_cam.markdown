A Pro-Cam Display System comprises of a projector and a camera. The central idea is that the image projected by the projector is compensated to suit the view-point of the camera. The view-point of the observers is imagined to be that of the camera and thus, the system projects a compensated image so as to render the source image at the observersâ€™ view-point. It is imperative that the field of view of the camera includes the area of projection of the projector.

Here, the problem of projecting display content on multiple display units using a single pro-cam system is considered. The aforementioned display units may be either static or dynamic. The problem is constrained to accurately detecting and tracking the display units and projecting the display content, using appropriate perspective transformation, assuming that the display surfaces are optimized for projection.

</div>

</div>

In doing so, no constraints are imposed on the movement of the display units except that they should always be within the area of projection of the projector. Also, no restriction is placed on the number of display units or the size of a display unit, provided it fits within the area of projection.
