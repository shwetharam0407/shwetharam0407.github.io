This [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6629914) was presented at the [2013 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference: South Asia Satellite (GHTC-SAS)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/6607257/proceeding)

Ocular Motility is a promising mode of input for human computer interaction. In this paper we describe an eye-controlled application which will be beneficial to the physically challenged community. Even people who can move only their eyes can use this with ease. This uses Image processing to translate the eye movements into mouse commands, thereby enabling the physically challenged to interact with a computer. A user friendly graphical user interface has been developed to demonstrate the merits of eye controlled input as a natural mode of human-machine interaction.
