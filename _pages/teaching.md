#### [__Greene Scholars Program__](https://www.greenescholars.org) 
Greene Scholars Program (GSP) is focussed on increasing STEM engagement for African American youth. I work with them as a volunteer in various capacities that include conducting mock interviews on Career Day, reviewing project proposals and judging the Annual Science Fair.  

#### [__San Jose Astronomical Association__](https://www.sjaa.net)
I volunteer for the [SJAA Loaner Program](https://www.sjaa.net/programs/loaner-telescope-program/), [star parties](https://www.sjaa.net/events/monthly-star-parties/) and some [solar observing events](https://www.sjaa.net/events/solar-observing/). This involves loaning out equipment and explaining the operation, setting up telescopes for viewing and interacting with the public.
