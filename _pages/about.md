My interests are in Computer Vision, Graphics and Machine Learning, with a focus on enabling immersive visual experiences. I believe that the future of video technology is about providing windows into other worlds, transporting users there or seamlessly blending those worlds into our own. How we capture, represent, transmit, render such volumetric videos or in other words, how we bring in this future, has been the focus of my work in recent years.

I am currently involved in algorithm development and prototyping to enable some immersive A/V/MR experiences at the Image Technology Incubation team of [Dolby Laboratories, Inc](https://www.dolby.com/us/en/index.html). Prior to that, I was a grad student in UC Santa Barbara and worked in the [Four Eyes Lab](https://ilab.cs.ucsb.edu), advised by [Prof. Matthew Turk](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~mturk/). My masters project was about [Retargeting Virtual Worlds](projects/RVW/). I completed my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India](https://www.nitk.ac.in). During my undergrad, I spent a good amount of time at the Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Lab of the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in), under the guidance of [Prof. K R Ramakrishnan](http://iiscprofiles.irins.org/profile/3742).  

Please see my [CV](/CV/) for more details.

I am a Carnatic Vocalist, a disciple of [Dr. T S Sathyavathi](https://www.tssathyavathi.com) - check out [my music corner](https://shwetharam0407.github.io/music-corner/) if interested. In my free time, I do some amateur astronomy with  [SJAA](https://www.sjaa.net) - a little more about this on my blog, [StarStuff](https://shwetharam0407.github.io/star-stuff/).
