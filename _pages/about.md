My interests are in solving the hard problems in Computer Vision and Graphics, for which Iâ€™ve employed both classical and Machine Learning techniques. Always looking for exciting opportunities to build technologies and experiences of the future.

I'm currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon Lab126. Prior to this, I was at the Image Technology Incubation team of [Dolby Laboratories, Inc.](https://www.dolby.com/us/en/index.html), working with an interdisciplinary team of hardware and software engineers on solutions to capture, represent, transmit, render and display immersive visual content for applications like AR and VR and exploring new opportunities for Dolby in this space.

Prior to that, I was a grad student in UC Santa Barbara and worked in the [Four Eyes Lab](https://ilab.cs.ucsb.edu), advised by [Prof. Matthew Turk](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~mturk/). My masters project was about [Retargeting Virtual Worlds](projects/RVW/). I completed my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India](https://www.nitk.ac.in). During my undergrad, I spent a good amount of time at the Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Lab of the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in), under the guidance of [Prof. K R Ramakrishnan](http://iiscprofiles.irins.org/profile/3742).  Please see my [CV](/CV/) for more details.

I am a Carnatic Vocalist, a disciple of [Dr. T S Sathyavathi](https://www.tssathyavathi.com) and also enjoy performing Bhavageethe (emotive poetry) - check out [my music corner](https://shwetharam0407.github.io/music-corner/) if interested. I also do some amateur astronomy with  [SJAA](https://www.sjaa.net) - a little more about this on my blog, [StarStuff](https://shwetharam0407.github.io/star-stuff/).
